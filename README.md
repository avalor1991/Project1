# BANDANA

This project was the first group project of the Penn Coding Boot Camp.

## Goal
To create an app to find concerts with your favorite artists, having everything you need in one tab. The app let the user search by artist, location and a range of dates, and shows information about the location, gives directions to the venue and displays a link to get tickets.

## Set-up
The users needs to enter their own API keys for the following services:
1. Google Maps API
2. Bands in Town API
3. Firebase DB

## Functionality
This simple yet powerfull application consists of two parts: a search form and a recent searches section. We would like to implement some new and exciting features in the near future:

**Implemented**
| Section              |  Action                                                  |
| ---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Search               |  Show up to 10 upcoming shows for a specific artist      |
| Recent Searches      |  Show the last (non-repeated) searches among all users   |

**Future Development**
| Feature               |  Description                                                                |
| ----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Log in                |  Allow users to log in in order to save their searches and favorite artists |
| More powerful search  |  Currently the *artist* field is required in order to search. We would like for the user to be able to search by location and/or dates without entering an artist name. We will also add a *genre* field, in order to look for events that match a specific music genre |
| Improve maps          |  The map displayed in the search results will be fully interacive, without leaving the site |
| Music sample          |  A music sample for the artist will be added to the search results |
| Most popular searches |  We will add a section at the bottom of the page that shows, not only the latest searches, but also the most searched for artists |
| One-button search     |  The recent searches section will be interactive in order for the user to trigger a search for a specific artist with just one click |
